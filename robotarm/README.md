# Robot arm - MeArm v1.0

Since the flawed version v0.4 from April 2014 is still sold at [lazada.vn](https://www.lazada.vn/products/4-dof-acrylic-chua-lap-rap-diy-canh-tay-robot-diy-bo-cho-arduino-may-lam-ho-tro-hoc-tap-sg90-servo-i267650656-s391094259.html) and [aliexpress.com](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33058691240.html) we look forward to create the much improved v1.0 from [MeArm](https://mearm.com) (or phenoptix alias Ben Gray from Nottingham) or [Mime Industries](https://mime.co.uk). It was published  September 2015. Thanks to a successful [Kickstarter campain](

The lasercut files can be found on [thingiverse 3420797](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3420797/files). But it needs M2.5 screws. I guess it is:

- 15x - M2.5 x 8mm
- 3x  - M2.5 x 10mm

- 4x  - M2.5 x 20mm

And we need a pcb at the bottom.
